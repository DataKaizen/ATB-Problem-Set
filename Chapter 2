# Chapter 2 Practice Questions

1. What are the 2 values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
- True
- False

2. What are the 3 Boolean operators?
- and
- or
- not

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).
- Basically if you have and, each value? must be True in order to evaluate to True
- If you have or, only 1 value must be True in order for it to evaluate to True
- NOT False -> True

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
True and False
False

not (5 > 4)
not True
False

(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
True or False
True

not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
not ( True or False)
not (True)
False

(True and True) and (True == False)
True and False
False

(not False) or (not True)
True or False
True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
>
<
==
>=
<=
!=

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
- equal to operator == is to compare 2 values to each other and evaluates to a boolean
- assignment operator = is to assign a value into a variable

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
- a condition is an expression used in a flow control statement that evaluates to a Boolean value
- conditions are used in loops. if the condition is True then program execution moves onto the block

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')              block 1
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')         block 2
    else:
        print('ham')           block 3
    print('spam')
print('spam')

9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

print('Please enter a number!')
spam = int(input())

if spam == 1:
    print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings!')

10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
Ctrl + C

11. What is the difference between break and continue?
- break will exit the loop
- continue will go back to the beginning of the loop

12. What is the difference between range(10), range (0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
- there is no difference between the 3
- range(start, end (excluding), step)

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop

# Program 1 For loop
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)

# Program 2 while loop
i = 1
while i < 11:
    print(i)
    i ++ 1

14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

spam.bacon()

Extra Credit: look up the round() and abs() function on the internet, and find out what they do. Experiment with them in the interactive shell.
